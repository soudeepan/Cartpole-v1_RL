# Description:
Welcome to my repository showcasing my adventure into Reinforcement Learning with the CartPole-v1 environment using the powerful Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model. Here, you'll find the code and resources detailing my journey as I trained an AI agent to balance a pole on a moving cart.

# Features:

PPO Implementation: Dive into the heart of reinforcement learning with my implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm.
Callback Integration: Explore how I leveraged callbacks to monitor training progress and improve performance.
TensorBoard Logs: Detailed logs for TensorBoard provide insights into the training dynamics and help optimize the agent's behavior.
Performance Optimization: Witness how I fine-tuned hyperparameters and strategies to enhance the agent's pole-balancing prowess.
Future Directions: Stay tuned for updates as I continue to push the boundaries of AI with new challenges and applications.
